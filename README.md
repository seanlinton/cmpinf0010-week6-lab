# cmpinf0010-week6-lab

## Description
The program, coded in Python, takes input for a name and a favorite number, then it figures out whether or not that number is odd or even, and displays that. If the number input is not actually a number, then the program tells the user that the input is not a number.

## Installation
To install this program, download the week6lab.ipynb file from GitHub, and then upload that file to JupyterLab.
